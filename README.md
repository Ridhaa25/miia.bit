# miia.bit robot
The MiiA.bit robot is a build-it-yourself robot designed by RD9 Solutions that teaches you the fundamentals of electronics, programming and robotics to ensure that you are relevant in an ever-changing future. This repository contains all the resources you need to get started with your robot. Don’t have a MiiA.bit robot? No problem. Visit www.rd-9.co.za to get yours shipped straight to you. 

## Getting started
To get started, download the MiiCode student app from either the Google play store or Apple AppStore. The Miicode app uses a blockly based programming platform which is used to communicate with the robot from either your smartphone or tablet via Bluetooth. The app also contains all the resources and curriculum needed to learn robotics.

To get familiar with the hardware and the Miicode app, please have a look at the getting started document in the getting started folder. 

Note: All the resources in this repository can be found within the robot support tab within your Miicode app.

## Assembly of robot
The MiiA.bit robot is designed in a 3D puzzle format. The assembly instructions folder contains all the instructions needed to assemble your robot. You will also notice that there are three documents in the folder. These instructions are for the extender packs which you may have purchased with the MiiA.bit robot and would want to integrate with. 

## Calibration
No two things are exactly alike. The same goes for robotics and motors. Although the motors used on the MiiA.bit robot are the same, there might be slight differences. This may cause your robot to move more to the left or right. To account for this, we need to calibrate the robot. This is done by adding an ‘offset’ to the motors.

For example, if we see the robot favouring the left motor. We add some number to that motor which will correct the movement to be equal to the other motor. This is done in the calibration tab in the MiiCode app. The sheet which can be used for the calibration of the robot is found in the calibration folder or robot support tab in the MiiCode app. This sheet contains the step-by-step instructions on how to calibrate your robot.

## Firmware
The firmware used to program the MiiA.bit robot has been open-sourced and can be found in the firmware folder in this repository. Therefore, if you feel you want to try out Arduino C programming with the MiiA.bit robot feel free to jump straight in. You can then always load the original firmware by accessing it here.

## Curriculum
All the curriculum is available in the MiiCode app in the curriculum tab. This does require you to log in and create a profile. We are constantly updating this curriculum to ensure that the information is current, up to date and relevant to current world trends. 

## Extensions kits
The MiiA.bit robot allows for a range of extensions which can be found on www.rd-9.co.za. As mentioned these instructions are present in the Assembly instructions folder. These kits are:

### MiiExpansion pack
This pack contains different linkages and fasteners to add to the functionality of the robot. This is compatible with all the robots designed by RD9 Solutions. 

### MiiGripper pack
The MiiGripper pack is based on the amazing open-source mearm robotic kit (https://mearm.com/). This extends the functionality of your MiiA.bit gripper by using the servo motor in your kit to create an arm capable of grasping and holding things.

 Note: This pack is currently only compatible with the MiiA.bit robot.
